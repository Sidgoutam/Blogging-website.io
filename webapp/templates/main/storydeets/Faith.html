    <h1>Faith 🌸 </h1>
    <p>
Badri was in the 9th grade when a girl named Kavya took admission in the school. When Badri saw her for the 1st time walking out of the principal’s office, Badri was dumbstruck. He stood there like he saw some angel of some kind. Badri’s vision wasn’t blurred around Kavya but the background was white light and she was carrying it. Badri was blown away that day and he’ll never forget it.<br><br>

After a few weeks it was pretty clear that every single guy of the batch felt the same way for Kavya. It was upto her now to choose among the lot. Kavya like every other girl took her time to analyze the boys, looking for the perfect one.<br><br>

Badri, though deep in love with her didn’t  really express anything because he thought why would a girl, so beautiful like her would ever choose a guy like him. But  Badri’s  aura was such that Kavya loved his company. Soon they became good friends and hung out a lot together. They had a secret place in the backyard of the school where they always went and talked for hours. They called it the “seclace” which is short for “secret place”.<br><br>

A year passed by and after the final exams everybody decided to party since they were going to enter the final year of school. It was a house party. The whole batch was there but Badri couldn’t find Kavya. He thought she might be late or something. Meanwhile the batch cut the cake and everyone picked a corner and started gossiping. Badri was standing in the balcony looking at the stars when Kavya entered. She was looking ravishing in that black dress. Badri, instead of saying something romantic or compliment her in the least, cracked some lame space jokes. Suddenly, she kissed him ! After a couple of seconds, he asked, “The space joke worked?”<br>

- “That’s the 1st thing you say after I kiss you ! ”<br>

- “That’s the 1st thing I said. The 1st thing I thought was if this really a good idea ? I mean, look at you. You are so beautiful and perfect and look at me. I am a dwarf ! Why choose someone like me ?”<br>

- “If you think that’s the reason I shouldn’t kiss you then you don’t know me at all”<br>

Badri then kissed Kavya and this time he says that he loves her. Kavya seemed like she didn’t want to kiss anymore. Without saying anything she just left. Badri was super confused about what just happened. He kept wondering if she didn’t like it or was it a bad breath or any of the 140 reasons.<br><br>

They next day at school, as soon as Badri entered the class, Kavya, as if eagerly waiting for him, ran towards and whispered in his ears to keep it a secret and not to tell anyone. Badri got a little nervous as all his fears suddenly started to be true but knowing her for a year by then he decided to trust her and said to self that she has a strict father so maybe that’s why she was afraid. Since a week after that Kavya didn’t really speak to Badri that well. She was more like ignoring him. Badri’s insecure game was growing stronger. Then one day during the recess period as Badri was deep in his thoughts about all that was going on, he heard one of his friends mentioning Kavya in his conversation. That got Badri’s attention. The guy said that Kavya kissed him. Hearing this Badri was shook to his core. He was literally shaking and didn’t really know what to do or what to say. Standing there, another guy said that Kavya was flirting with him the whole week. He also shared some pictures of her that she sent him and a screenshot of  their conversation. The others said that the girls dared each other at the party, they were playing some kind of games. Hearing all this Badri went running to his home, cried really hard. The thought of  Kavya playing with him really messed him up. He didn’t go to school for the next couple of days. He totally broke down when Kavya didn’t even try to contact him. Finally, Badri pulled himself together and the courage to go back to school and face the reality. Although he acted as if he was okay his eyes were looking for her. But she was absent. The next day, the same she was absent again. Poor Badri was worried about her but he couldn’t talk about it to anyone either. He just didn’t want others to notice that he was worried about her whereabouts.<br><br>

It was a week since she came to school. Now Badri ran out of patience. He went to one of her friends and asked her where she was and why wasn’t she coming to school.<br><br>

The girl relied – “Oh didn’t you hear ? Her father transferred her to another school. The boys spread stories about her and it somehow got to the principal. Then the truth came out that these boys were lying and Kavya’s father got furious about the whole situation so they left the city.”<br><br>

Heartbroken Badri, after the school went to the seclace and sat there. Sobbed for long and while he was returning he saw a letter on the door handle. It read,<br>

“<br>

Dear Badri,<br>

          I love you too. Wish I could say this face to face but you know how shy I am. I am sorry I didn’t behave properly since our kiss. My dad somehow figured it out and he threatened me if I don’t stop talking to you he’ll complain your parents. I was scared and didn’t want to cause you any trouble. But that won’t change the fact that I love you. I think I felt this way the day we discovered this seclace. Wish I had said you that day then we might have celebrated our anniversary today. Or our friendship would have come to an end who knows.<br>

Anyway, I am glad I met someone like you and I will never forget you. Hopefully we meet again someday.<br>

Love Kavya<br>
